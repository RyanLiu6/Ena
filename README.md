Extracts transaction information from Bank Statements for Canadian Financial Institutions into CSV.

## Credits

Credits to [Bizzaro](https://github.com/Bizzaro), whose fork of [Teller](https://github.com/Bizzaro/Teller) was my goto tool for a period of time. I found myself wanting to make something similar with some changes to benefit my personal use-case. So, full credits to them, as their Regex code for processing statements was extremely helpful for creating a base to work off of.
